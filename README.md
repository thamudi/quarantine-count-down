# quarantine-count-down

Quarantine countdown app

Authors: Tamim Hamoudi

## Overview

This simple application will countdown the days, hours, minutes and seconds until the quarantine at hand will end

This app was built from the ground up with nothing more than pure ES6 JS 

The only library here is the [JS Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) template engine renderer to keep the code cleaner and for faster development.
